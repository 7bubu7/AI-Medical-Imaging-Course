# 📘 Lesson 1 – Numpy & Matplotlib for Medical Imaging

This notebook was completed as part of an AI for Medical Imaging course, focused on foundational Python libraries for data and image manipulation. It covers the basics of using **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**, essential tools for working with medical data.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- NumPy array creation, slicing, reshaping, and broadcasting
- Basic statistics and logic indexing with NumPy
- Data visualization using Matplotlib (line plot, histogram, scatter plot, imshow)
- Understanding image as matrix for future medical image processing

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Mini Exercises Covered
- Generate 1D/2D random arrays and visualize them
- Normalize vectors and display them using `plt.plot` and `plt.imshow`
- Create and manipulate 3D arrays
- Add padding to arrays and perform operations like max/min, masking, and negation
