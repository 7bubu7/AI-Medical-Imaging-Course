üß† Lesson 3 - CNNs & Retinopathy Classification for Medical Imaging

This notebook series is part of an AI for Medical Imaging course. In this module, we explored **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for medical image classification and applied the techniques to **pneumonia diagnosis (CXR)** and **diabetic retinopathy classification** (Kaggle dataset with 5 severity levels).
