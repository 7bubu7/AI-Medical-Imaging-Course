# 📘 Lesson 2 – PyTorch Basics for Image Classification

This notebook was created as part of an AI for Medical Imaging course. In this lesson, we built and trained simple neural networks using PyTorch, applied to image classification datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10). The goal was to understand the full pipeline of a deep learning model from input to prediction.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- PyTorch tensor operations and model structure
- Building a fully connected neural network using `nn.Linear` and `nn.Sequential`
- Loss functions: MSE, BCE, and CrossEntropy
- Optimization with `torch.optim.SGD` and `torch.optim.Adam`
- Training loop structure: forward pass, loss calculation, backpropagation, and parameter update
- Model evaluation on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Google Colab
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 🧪 Files
- `[HW]MNIST_PyTorch.ipynb`: A fully connected neural network for digit classification on MNIST
- `01_PyTorch_Linear_CIFAR10.ipynb`: A simple classifier using linear layers on the CIFAR-10 dataset
