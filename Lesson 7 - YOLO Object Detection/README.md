📦 Lesson 07 – YOLO for Object Detection (BCCD Dataset)

This lesson introduces the fundamentals of object detection and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm series. Through hands-on implementation with the BCCD blood cell dataset, I explored how to train and evaluate YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 models using annotated medical images.

 🧠 What I Learned

- Basics of object detection: bounding boxes, IoU, NMS
- Evolution from YOLOv1 to YOLOv8: architecture and improvements
- Anchor boxes and grid systems in detection models
- Understanding YOLO prediction outputs
- YOLO loss functions and training structure
- How to annotate datasets in PASCAL VOC format
- Practical use of YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 for medical image detection
