 üìò Notebooks

- `3D Brain Tumor Segmentation.ipynb`  
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Demonstrates 3D segmentation using volumetric data with 3D CNNs (`nn.Conv3d`, `nn.ConvTranspose3d`).

- `3D Chest CT Classification.ipynb`  
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Classifies diseases based on 3D CT scans using video-based pretrained models like `r3d_18`.

- `ECG Classification.ipynb`  
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Classifies arrhythmia types from 1D ECG signal data using 1D CNNs (`nn.Conv1d`).

- `GradCAM.ipynb`  
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Applies Grad-CAM to highlight the regions contributing to classification decisions (explainability in AI).

üéØ Key Concepts

- **3D Convolution**: Use of 3D CNNs for volumetric medical images (e.g., MRI, CT).
- **1D Convolution**: Temporal signal processing, especially for ECG analysis.
- **Explainable AI**: Interpretability tools like Grad-CAM for clinical validation.
- **Annotation Challenges**:
  - Small labeled datasets
  - Class imbalance
  - Cross-domain variability
  - Federated Learning for privacy-preserving training
